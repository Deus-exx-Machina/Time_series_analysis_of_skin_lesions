These include asymmetry in shape, irregular borders, and uneven distribution of pigment, with variations in color across the lesion. The presence of dark brown to black areas is also a worrisome sign. The size of the lesion cannot be determined without a reference scale, however, the presence of these features increases the likelihood of malignancy and warrants further investigation, such as a biopsy.\"}",
