    "q1_general_response": "{\"question\": \"What are the distinguishing features of the pigmented lesion observed in the dermoscopic image?\", \"answer\": \"The dermoscopic image reveals a brown-pigmented lesion with a somewhat round shape and irregular borders. Hair follicles are visible throughout the image, including within the lesion itself. The lesion also presents an irregular pigment network.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a brown color that is concentrated centrally and fades towards the periphery, indicating an uneven color distribution. The border appears to be mostly well-defined but slightly irregular in some areas. There are no obvious raised areas, suggesting it is a flat lesion. These details could influence classification by raising suspicion for certain types of melanocytic nevi or early melanomas, which often display irregular borders and uneven pigmentation. A flat profile would also narrow the differential diagnosis.\"}",
