    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, the lesion appears to be a nevus, commonly known as a mole. Moles are common skin growths that are usually harmless. This particular mole appears to have a uniform color and a regular border. While most moles are benign, it's always a good idea to monitor them for any changes in size, shape, color, or elevation, and to report any changes or new moles to a dermatologist, especially if they are accompanied by itching, bleeding, or pain. Regular skin self-exams and professional skin exams can help detect any potential problems early.\"}",
