    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"The image shows skin with multiple hairs and what appears to be a slightly raised, somewhat circular, light brown or tan lesion. There is a subtle variation in pigmentation within the lesion. The skin surrounding the lesion appears pinkish. Some small blood vessels are visible. \"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a color transition from a light pink/flesh tone to a more yellow/tan hue in the central area. The edges appear somewhat indistinct, blending into the surrounding skin. Based on the image alone, the lesion does not appear particularly thick. The color transition could indicate changes within the lesion over time, possibly related to inflammation, pigmentation, or regression. However, without additional information or a physical examination, it's difficult to determine the progression definitively. \"}",
