    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"The image shows a skin lesion that appears to be a mole or nevus. It is a roughly circular, pigmented macule with irregular borders. The color is not uniform, with variations in brown and tan shades. There are some fine hairs visible on the surrounding skin and passing over the lesion itself.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion presents with a color transition from a light brown center to a dark brown periphery. The edges appear irregular and somewhat indistinct. While the thickness cannot be accurately assessed from the image, the color variation and irregular border suggest the possibility of progression, meriting further evaluation for potential malignancy.\"}",
