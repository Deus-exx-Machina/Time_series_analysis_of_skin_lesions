    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a light tan color with some darker brown spots. The outline is irregular and somewhat indistinct due to the presence of surrounding hair follicles. The elevation appears to be mostly flat, but this is difficult to determine with certainty due to the angle of the image. The presence of a tan color with irregular borders could suggest a benign melanocytic nevus, but the darker brown spots warrant further evaluation to rule out the possibility of melanoma. The treatment options would vary based on the final diagnosis, ranging from simple monitoring to surgical excision.\"}",
