    "q1_general_response": "{\"question\": \"Based on the dermoscopic image, what are the key features of the pigmented lesion and what diagnostic considerations should be raised?\", \"answer\": \"The dermoscopic image shows a pigmented lesion with an overall brown color. The lesion exhibits a reticular pattern internally and radial streaming at the periphery. These features raise concern for a melanocytic lesion, specifically a possible melanoma, but a benign nevus with atypical features cannot be excluded without further assessment. Evaluation should include clinical correlation and potential biopsy to determine diagnosis and guide management.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, the lesion might represent a melanocytic nevus (mole), possibly dysplastic given the irregular borders and varied pigmentation. However, a thorough clinical examination and potentially a biopsy would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out melanoma.\"}",
