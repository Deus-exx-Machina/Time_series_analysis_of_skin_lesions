    "q1_general_response": "{\"question\": \"What dermoscopic features are suggestive of a melanocytic nevus, as opposed to melanoma, in this image?\", \"answer\": \"In this image, the presence of a regular pigment network, even distribution of color, and symmetrical shape suggests a melanocytic nevus, a benign mole. Absence of irregular blotches, atypical vascular patterns, and ulceration supports the diagnosis of a nevus over melanoma. \"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a brown color with variations in intensity, with both lighter and darker shades present. The borders appear irregular and ill-defined in some areas. The texture seems to be mostly flat, although subtle variations in elevation could be present.\n\nThe color distribution and irregular borders might suggest a potential for malignancy, warranting further investigation. A more uniform color and well-defined borders would be more characteristic of a benign lesion.\"}",
