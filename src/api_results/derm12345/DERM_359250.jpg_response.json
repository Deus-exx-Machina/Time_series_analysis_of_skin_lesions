    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion presents with a dark brown color centrally, fading to a lighter brown towards the periphery. The border appears irregular and poorly defined, with some areas showing a fuzzy or indistinct edge. The texture seems slightly raised and irregular. These features raise suspicion for a melanocytic lesion with potential for malignancy, such as melanoma. Further evaluation, including dermoscopy and possibly biopsy, is recommended to rule out malignancy.\"}",
