    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the dermoscopic image, the lesion exhibits features suggestive of a benign vascular lesion, such as a cherry angioma or telangiectasia. The presence of multiple, well-defined, round to oval, red-to-purple lacunae, with a relatively homogenous distribution of color and the absence of other concerning features like atypical vessels or pigment network, further supports this diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis requires clinical correlation and, in some cases, a biopsy to rule out other possibilities.\"}",
