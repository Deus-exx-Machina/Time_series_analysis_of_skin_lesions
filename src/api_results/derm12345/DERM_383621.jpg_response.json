    "q1_general_response": "{\"question\": \"Based on the dermoscopic image, what are the concerning features of this pigmented lesion that should be evaluated?\", \"answer\": \"This pigmented lesion shows concerning dermoscopic features including asymmetry, irregular borders, and multiple colors (dark brown, light brown, and black). The presence of a large, dark area along the edge is particularly concerning, along with an overall heterogeneous pigment network. These features raise suspicion for a possible melanocytic lesion and warrant further clinical evaluation and possible biopsy to rule out malignancy.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"This is a close-up view of a skin lesion, likely a mole, examined with a special magnifying tool called a dermatoscope. The dermatoscope helps to see features not visible to the naked eye. The different colors and patterns observed are important. The dark black area and the variation in color and texture throughout the lesion need to be evaluated by a dermatologist to determine if it's a typical mole or something that requires further investigation, like a biopsy, to rule out skin cancer.\"}",
