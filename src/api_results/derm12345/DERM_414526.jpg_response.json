    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, the lesion appears to have some pigment network-like structures and some areas of redness. It also has some hairs growing on it, which is pretty normal for skin lesions. I would recommend a clinical examination to fully assess this lesion.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a color transition from light tan to darker brown with some areas of pinkish-red. The edges appear somewhat irregular and ill-defined in areas. It's difficult to assess thickness from this image alone, but it seems relatively flat. The color variation and irregular edges could suggest some potential for progression or change over time, warranting further evaluation.\"}",
