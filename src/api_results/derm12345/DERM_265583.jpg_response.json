    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image alone, the lesion appears to be a pigmented lesion. To differentiate it from similar conditions like seborrheic keratosis, dysplastic nevus, or melanoma, I would need to assess the lesion using the ABCDE criteria: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter (greater than 6mm), and Evolving. Dermoscopy would also be helpful to evaluate specific features like the presence of a pigment network, globules, streaks, or regression structures. These features would help determine if the lesion is benign, dysplastic, or suspicious for melanoma.\"}",
