The lesion exhibits relatively uniform color distribution with a slightly darker central area. The borders are somewhat irregular, fading into the surrounding skin. Fine telangiectasias (small blood vessels) are visible around the periphery. The clinical characteristics suggest a benign lesion. Potential differential diagnoses include: a dermatofibroma (although these are typically firmer and more raised), a regressing solar lentigo, or a Spitz nevus.\"}",
