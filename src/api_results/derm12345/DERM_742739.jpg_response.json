    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, it appears you have a pigmented lesion on your skin. I see some asymmetry in its shape, irregular borders, and variations in color. While it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the lesion from the image alone, these features can sometimes be associated with atypical moles or other skin conditions that require further evaluation. To be safe, I recommend a thorough examination using dermoscopy, which will allow me to see the lesion in greater detail. Depending on the findings, we may consider a biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. Early detection is key when it comes to skin lesions, so it's always best to get these things checked out. \"}",
