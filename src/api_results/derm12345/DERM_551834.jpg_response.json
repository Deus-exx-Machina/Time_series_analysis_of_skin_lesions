Conditions that might present similarly include: 1. Seborrheic Keratosis: These are common, benign skin growths that can have a waxy, stuck-on appearance and variable pigmentation. 2. Actinic Keratosis: These are precancerous lesions that can have a rough, scaly texture and irregular borders. 3. Melanoma: Although less likely without more information, melanoma can sometimes present with irregular borders, variable pigmentation, and surface changes. 4. Dysplastic nevus: An atypical mole that could have irregular features and be difficult to distinguish from melanoma based on visual inspection alone.\"}",
