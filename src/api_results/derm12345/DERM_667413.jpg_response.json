I recommend we monitor it for any changes in size, shape, color, or if it becomes itchy or starts to bleed. If any of these occur, we'll need to investigate it further.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion presents with a brown color, displaying variations in shade. The border appears somewhat irregular and ill-defined in certain areas. The texture seems smooth with fine lines and subtle surface irregularities. These features could suggest a melanocytic nevus, but given the irregular border and color variation, a complete evaluation to rule out melanoma is recommended.\"}",
