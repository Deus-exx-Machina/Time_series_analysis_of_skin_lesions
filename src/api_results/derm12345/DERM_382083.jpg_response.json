    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, it appears you have a mole or pigmented lesion on your skin. It's a brown patch with slightly irregular borders and some variation in color within the lesion. While it's difficult to determine the exact nature without a closer examination, these features warrant further evaluation to rule out any atypical or concerning characteristics. I recommend we perform a thorough skin examination and possibly dermoscopy (a magnified view of the lesion) to assess it more closely. In some cases, a biopsy might be necessary to get a definitive diagnosis. It's important to monitor any changes in size, shape, color, or symptoms like itching or bleeding and report them to me promptly.\"}",
