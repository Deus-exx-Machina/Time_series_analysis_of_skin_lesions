Atypical nevus (dysplastic nevus): These moles can have irregular borders, uneven color, and asymmetry, similar to melanoma, but are not cancerous.\n2.  Seborrheic keratosis: Although typically benign, some seborrheic keratoses can be darkly pigmented and have irregular borders, mimicking melanoma.\n3.  Lentigo: A benign pigmented spot with a well-defined border. While generally uniform in color, some lentigines can display variations that may require differentiation from melanoma.\n4.  Pigmented basal cell carcinoma: Although typically presenting with other characteristic features, some pigmented basal cell carcinomas can resemble melanomas in their early stages.\n\"}",
