    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Given the features visible in the image, I recommend the following steps for further evaluation:\n\n1.  **Clinical History**: Obtain a detailed clinical history of the lesion/disease, including the onset, duration, any associated symptoms (itching, pain, bleeding), previous treatments, and relevant medical history.\n2.  **Physical Examination**: Perform a thorough physical examination of the lesion/disease, including palpation to assess its texture, consistency, and depth. Assess the surrounding skin for any signs of inflammation or other abnormalities.\n3.  **Dermoscopic Examination**: Perform a dermoscopic examination of the lesion/disease to evaluate its specific morphological features and patterns.\n4.  **Differential Diagnosis**: Develop a differential diagnosis based on the clinical history, physical examination, and dermoscopic findings.\n5.  **Further Investigations**: Depending on the differential diagnosis, consider further investigations such as:\n\n    *   **Biopsy**: If there is suspicion of malignancy or diagnostic uncertainty, perform a biopsy to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological examination.\n    *   **Culture**: If there is suspicion of infection, obtain a sample for culture to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate treatment.\n    *   **Imaging Studies**: In certain cases, imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may be necessary to evaluate the extent and depth of the lesion/disease.\n\n6.  **Treatment Plan**: Based on the diagnosis and further investigations, develop an appropriate treatment plan tailored to the individual patient and their specific condition.\n\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion appears reddish-brown with some areas of white scaling or crusting. The border is irregular and not well-defined. The texture appears uneven with some raised areas, possibly papules or nodules. The presence of irregular borders, color variation, and uneven texture are concerning features that could suggest a neoplastic process, such as skin cancer. However, other inflammatory or infectious processes could also present with similar characteristics.\"}",
