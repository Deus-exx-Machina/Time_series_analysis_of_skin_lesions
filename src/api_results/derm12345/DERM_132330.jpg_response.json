    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, the secondary diagnoses that might fit the lesion's visual presentation include:\n\n1.  **Seborrheic Keratosis:** This is a common benign skin growth that can appear as a raised, waxy, or scaly spot with a \\\"pasted-on\\\" appearance. The color can vary from light tan to dark brown.\n\n2.  **Lentigo (Solar Lentigo):** Also known as age spots or sunspots, these are flat, brown spots that typically appear in areas exposed to the sun.\n\n3.  **Dysplastic Nevus (Atypical Mole):** While it's difficult to determine without further examination, dysplastic nevi can have irregular borders, uneven color, and may be larger than common moles.\n\n4.  **Spitz Nevus:** This is a type of benign mole that often appears in children and young adults. They can vary in color and may sometimes be raised or dome-shaped.\n\n5.  **Neurofibroma:** Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors that can sometimes appear as skin-colored or slightly pigmented bumps or nodules.\n\nIt is important to note that these are just potential secondary diagnoses based on the visual appearance of the lesion in the image. A definitive diagnosis would require a thorough clinical examination, dermatoscopic evaluation, and possibly a biopsy.\"}",

It's important to monitor moles for any changes in size, shape, color, or texture, as these could be signs of a problem. I recommend scheduling a consultation for a thorough examination to determine if further evaluation or action is needed.\"}",
