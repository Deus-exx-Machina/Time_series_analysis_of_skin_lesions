    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"This image shows a skin lesion that needs careful evaluation. I see an asymmetrical mole with uneven borders and variations in color. These are features that can sometimes be associated with melanoma, a type of skin cancer. However, many moles with these characteristics are benign. To determine whether this lesion is of concern, I recommend a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of the lesion for microscopic examination by a pathologist. The results of the biopsy will allow us to determine the nature of the lesion and whether any further treatment is needed. It's important to address these types of lesions early, so I'm glad you brought it to my attention.\"}",
