    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, it appears there's a brown spot or lesion on your skin. It's roundish and has fairly even coloring, but it's hard to say more without a closer look and possibly some tests. It's important to get it checked out by a doctor to make sure it's not something concerning, like a mole that's changing or something else that needs treatment. They might want to do a biopsy to be sure.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a brown pigmentation. Its margins appear irregular and poorly defined. The surface is obscured by hair, making it difficult to assess texture, but it appears relatively flat. These characteristics raise suspicion for an atypical melanocytic lesion, warranting further evaluation for potential malignancy.\"}",
