    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a variegated color distribution, with shades of pink, brown, and lighter patches intermingling. The borders appear irregular and somewhat indistinct, fading into the surrounding skin in certain areas. There are both raised and flat areas, creating a textured surface. These details would significantly influence classification by suggesting potential irregularity and asymmetry, factors often considered when assessing skin lesions for malignancy. The variegated color and irregular borders, in particular, would raise suspicion and necessitate further evaluation to rule out conditions such as melanoma.\"}",
