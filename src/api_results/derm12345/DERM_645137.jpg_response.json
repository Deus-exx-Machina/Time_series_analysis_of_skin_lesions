    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"The image shows a skin lesion, possibly a mole, with notable visual features including its dark brown to black color, irregular borders, and uneven texture. There are also hairs growing around and within the lesion, and the surrounding skin appears normal in color and texture.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion exhibits a lack of color uniformity with shades of dark brown and black intermixed. The border appears irregular and ill-defined. The tactile feel cannot be determined from the image, but would need to be assessed via palpation. The asymmetry, border irregularity, and color variegation are concerning features that warrant further investigation. Further testing, such as dermoscopy and potentially biopsy, would be helpful to evaluate for malignancy. \"}",
