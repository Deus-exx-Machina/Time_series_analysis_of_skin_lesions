    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image, it appears you have a dark mole with a somewhat irregular border. The color is quite uniform, but there seems to be some variation in the shades of brown. While I can't make a definitive diagnosis from a picture alone, it's important to monitor any mole for changes in size, shape, color, or any new symptoms like itching or bleeding. I would recommend scheduling an appointment for a proper skin exam to evaluate the mole more closely and determine if any further action is needed, such as a biopsy. Early detection is key for any skin concerns, so it's always best to get it checked out.\"}",
