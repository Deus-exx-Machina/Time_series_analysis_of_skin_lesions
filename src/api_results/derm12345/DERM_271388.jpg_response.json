However, several features are concerning and warrant further evaluation. These include the presence of asymmetry, irregular borders, and variation in color (darker and lighter areas). These are all features associated with the ABCDEs of melanoma detection. Therefore, a biopsy should be considered to rule out malignancy.\"}",
