    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion in the image exhibits characteristics suggestive of a melanocytic nevus (mole). The brown pigmentation and relatively well-defined borders are consistent with this type of skin lesion. However, a thorough clinical examination and potentially a biopsy would be necessary to definitively rule out other possibilities, including atypical nevi or early melanoma.\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion is brown in color. The border appears to be irregular and indistinct, blending into the surrounding skin. The texture appears to be smooth. Based on these characteristics, the lesion could be a nevus (mole), but given the irregular border, a consultation with a dermatologist would be prudent to rule out atypical nevus or melanoma.\"}",
