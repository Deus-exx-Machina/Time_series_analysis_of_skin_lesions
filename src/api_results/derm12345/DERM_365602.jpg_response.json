There also seems to be some variation in the texture within the lesion. These characteristics can sometimes indicate an atypical mole, which has a higher chance of becoming cancerous. It's important to have this mole evaluated by a dermatologist to determine if a biopsy is necessary to rule out melanoma or another type of skin cancer.\"}",
