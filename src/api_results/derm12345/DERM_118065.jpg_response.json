    "q1_general_response": "{\"answer\": \"Based on the image alone, here's a possible ranking of alternative diagnoses:\n\n1.  Seborrheic Keratosis: The lesion has some characteristics of seborrheic keratosis, such as irregular borders and variable pigmentation.\n2.  Dysplastic Nevus (Atypical Mole):  The lesion displays some irregularity in color and border, raising the possibility of a dysplastic nevus.\n3.  Lentigo/Solar Lentigo (Age Spot): The relatively uniform color in parts of the lesion could suggest a lentigo. However, the darker areas and irregular border make this less likely than the above two.\n\"}",
    "q2_dataset_response": "{\"answer\": \"The lesion displays a mix of brown and tan hues, suggesting color variegation. Its border appears irregular and indistinct in areas. Although tactile feel cannot be directly assessed from the image, the presence of surface irregularities implies it may feel uneven. These observations raise suspicion for malignancy, warranting further investigation via biopsy to determine the lesion's cellular composition and guide appropriate management.\"}",
